## Project Introduction

Documentation [wiki](https://docs.sirenai.org)
Documentation Repository [github](https://github.com/yunzaixi-dev/sirenai-docs)

SirenAI is an open-source fork of [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern), licensed under AGPL-3.0. This project was established to better serve:

- [LeiNao](https://discord.gg/bNmEB4SK9h) - Chinese AI Character Card Open Source Community
- [SiRen](https://discord.gg/f6VfJU86SQ) - Another Chinese AI Character Card Open Source Community (where our project name comes from)

## Project Vision

We plan to perform a 100% reconstruction of SillyTavern using the Flutter framework, migrating the tavern's cloud logic to the client side to achieve:

- 🚀 Significant performance improvements
- 💫 Enhanced user experience
- 🔒 Improved security
- 🔄 Maximum compatibility maintained
